# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery
This repository presents a capstone project developed during the *IBM SkillsBuild AI & Cloud Internship, a collaborative initiative by **IBM, **AICTE, and the **Edunet Foundation*.

The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning solution that can predict mechanical failures in industrial equipment using real-time sensor data. By identifying issues before they occur, organizations can reduce unplanned downtime and adopt a proactive maintenance approach.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge involves creating a predictive maintenance model that classifies machine states based on sensor readings. The possible classifications include:

•⁠  ⁠Tool Wear  
•⁠  ⁠Heat Dissipation Malfunction  
•⁠  ⁠Electrical Failure  
•⁠  ⁠Normal Operation  

This allows for early fault detection and timely maintenance.

	⁠*Dataset Used:* [Kaggle - Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machinepredictive-maintenance-classification)  
	⁠*Platform Requirement:* IBM Cloud Lite Services
