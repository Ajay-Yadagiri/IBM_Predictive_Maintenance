# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

This repository showcases a capstone project developed during the **IBM SkillsBuild AI & Cloud Internship**, a collaborative initiative by **IBM**, **AICTE**, and the **Edunet Foundation**.

The project focuses on building a machine learning model to forecast mechanical failures using real-time sensor data. By leveraging predictive strategies, industries can reduce unexpected downtime and maintain continuous operations through timely interventions.

## Challenge Overview
### Objective  
Develop a predictive maintenance model that analyzes sensor inputs and classifies machine status into the following categories:

- Tool Wear  
- Heat Dissipation Malfunction  
- Electrical Failure  
- No Failure (Normal Operation)  

Proactively identifying machine issues is vital for optimizing productivity and reducing maintenance costs.
